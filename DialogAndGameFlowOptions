Room 1 (The Farm)
It’s been years since there has been any adventure in the small town of Purdue. 
Long days and quiet nights, the same routine day in and day out. It is just a simple 
child  and his mother trying to make due. This is where our story begins….

Choose your name

(First Room- Farm)
“Name” you have the choice to start your story here or go back to bed. Press “command” 
to go and talk to your mother or press “command” to go to bed.
 
Mother: “Good morning my dear child. Have you heard the news? The King’s daughter has 
been kidnapped by the “Warlock”. The people in the village have always talked about a 
day like this coming, but I just wasn’t sure when it would be. They spoke of a prophecy
that would be our savior. There are strange clouds forming around Fire Mountain and 
beginning to come this way. I’m afraid of what’s going to happen. I know you’re curious
my child, so don’t wander too far.”
She is right. You noticed the clouds forming this morning as you started your daily chores.
Something uneasy was in the air, you could feel it with every breathe. Adventure was finally here.
To the “east” is the village where you can begin your journey, to the “north” is your house where 
you can continue about your boring life and go to bed. Press “command” to go east. Press “command” to go north.
North: Thank you for playing. Goodbye.Exit the game.
East: Goes to the village

 
Room 2 (The Village)
The village was not a long way from the farm. Somewhere you liked to go often to get 
your farm tools fixed. The best blacksmith for miles around always fixed them for free
 because he knew that you couldn’t afford it. He travelled many places and always knew the latest news.
Talk to the black smith..

Name: “Afternoon mister.”

Black Smith: “What can I do you for today, kid. Did you break your shovel again or does your axe need sharpening?”

Name: “No not today. I came to ask about the mysterious clouds. They seem to be 
heading towards the farm and darkness is taking over the sky.”

Black Smith: “No one really knows why the clouds are rolling in. I just got back 
from the “town” and I heard the towns folk talking about the darkness coming because 
the Warlock stole the King’s daughter.”
Name: “But that don’t explain nothing about the clouds.”

Black Smith: “They said that the old Warlock was brewing up something mighty nasty. 
Story has it, that he needs the princesses blood so he can cast a spell on all of 
the people in the land and finally become the greatest ruler of all time. Once the 
clouds surround us, there will be nothing left but darkness.”

Name: “My mother talked of a prophecy and that means someone could save…”

Black Smith: “Prophecy. Ha! Who in their right mind is going to do that?”

This is your chance. Are you in your right mind or are you going to risk it all? 
Choose this “command” to continue or choose this “command” to go back home to your
 mother and tell her the unfortunate news.

Continue…

Name: “If nobody else will do it, then I will.”

Blacksmith: “Kid, you’re crazy. You can’t! There is more than just clouds on that 
path. There are enemies you will encounter stronger than you can imagine, seas full
 of creatures that you have never even heard of, and valleys that are so hot they 
 can kill you in seconds.”

 Name: “Don’t put your limits on me. Just because you and everyone else is scared, 
 doesn’t mean I have to be. I’m going.”

Blacksmith: “Well kid I can’t stop you but I won’t allow you to go out there 
without a weapon. Please will you take one with you. Anything in my shop.”

Choose between swords.

Blacksmith: “Here is a map of where you will find what you are looking for. 
There are items you will need to help you along the way, without them you will 
never survive. Please take my advice and stay on track. Word of advice kid, trolls 
aren’t always dangerous.”

Looking at the map you can see you can go back to farm to the west and the troll 
bridge was to the east. Choose this command to go home and choose this command to 
go to the troll bridge.
 
Room 3 (Troll Bridge)

After travelling on a broken rigorous path you come upon a weathered bridge. The 
fog is thickening and the only thing you can see is a shadow in the distance. The
 road was becoming harder as mounds of rocks made it more difficult to pass. The 
 rocks on the ground began cracking and breaking, sounding as if you were walking 
 on eggshells. The shadow is getting closer with each step you take. You reach down 
 to grab a rock, and for the first time you realize the rocks were actually bones.

Do you draw your sword?

****Draw your sword and kill the troll and not receive the item.*****
****Outwit the troll. And receive item you need.******



Room 4 (Forest)
Just past the troll bridge the trees grew dense. The path was not visible any longer 
and the night was setting in as well as exhaustion. Sleep is all you can think about 
as your body wears down. The forest is not a place to rest your head, trudging on is 
the only option. Streaks of moonlight shine through the branches of the trees. Screeches 
and sounds of the forest are loud and daunting as you try not to get lost. The later 
the time grew, the more hallucinations you began to see. Trees began dancing, their 
branches swaying as if they were arms. The trees themselves seemed as if they were 
coming to life. This was no hallucination at all.
**** You have to fight the trees. *****

Room 5 (Meadow)
The meadow is full of home remedies. Flowers and roots of all sorts. Here you can restore 
your health. To create to a potion to heal you, solve the following riddle.

****Solve riddle/puzzle.*****

Sounds of giggles and laughter are coming from a patch of wildflowers. You walk toward 
the sounds and find two little girls picking flowers.
Girl: “Hey there young man. Where are you going?”
Name: “I am headed to the evil kingdom to save the princess.”
Girl: “Oh my. What a dangerous road lies before you. Go talk to the wizard in the village 
before you go any further. He can help you.”

Choose to go talk to the wizard or not go talk to wizard.
 



Room 6 (The Wizards House/ This could be in the village/farm as well.)

Back at the village, you go down an old road that you aren’t familiar with. It was a 
part of town your mother would never allow you to go to. The directions the girls gave
you must have been wrong. They lead you down a dark alleyway with no window or doors.
Under crumpled cardboard boxes you see something shining through the trash. It is 
the latch to a door that leads down, way down. A black gothic staircase spiraled 
down into a small room that was lit by candle light. A voice came from the corner of the room. 

Wizard: “My precious curious child, what can I help you with today?”
Name: “The girls from the meadow told me you could help me. See, I am on a journey…”
Wizard: “I already know who you are child. I can help you, but for a small price.”

****Riddle/ puzzle (maybe)**** 
Name receives magic/weapon. 

Looking at the map, you could see the next place to go was through the swamp. The 
swamp was miles wide with no way to go around it. Feeling well equipped with the items the wizard 
gave you. 

Room 7 (The Swamp)

Smells of gases seeped out of the ground leaving a thick taste in your mouth. The 
swamp was worse than you expected. Bubbles were popping and splashing. Whatever the
 water touched it melted like it had be doused with acid. Danger surrounds you as 
 you travel deeper, and deeper into the swamp. The water, giant rats, and quicksand!!
  How are you going to get passed this?

****Do something**** 

Congratulations!! You have reached the halfway point. Follow the map to the Witch’s 
Den to restore your strength and health.  

Room 8 (The Witch’s Den)

A cottage deep in the woods hides under the roots of the earth. As you walk in snakes 
slither across the floor and mice scurry into the empty cabinets. It looks as if no one
 has been here in years. 

NAME: “Hello…”

BANG!! The doors and windows slam shut and lock from the outside in. You are trapped!
 A fire sparks by itself in the fireplace. Three shadows move around the room, heckling 
 loudly at the sight of you. 
Witch: “Smelly one aren’t you child.”
Name: “I just came from the swamps. I’m on my way to save the princess and I have no
 strength left. The sky keeps getting darker and I am running out of time. Please can you help me?”

The three witches rummaged through their potions and spell books to find what would help you the most. 

Witch: “Ah hah. This is the one. We just need a little help from you and you will feel much better.”
***Help the witches with the spell.***
Restore health and strength.


Room 9 (The Deadly Sea)

The sea is quiet and the water is still. Night has fallen and memories of your mother 
and the farm are haunting your mind. Dark thoughts spiral around your head as you look 
into the water trying to find the hope that you are missing. Gazing down into the gaping
 abyss, time stood still. Before your eyes shapes began forming and the water swiftly 
 gained consciousness. Souls from every walk of life has been taken by this sea. The
  deadly sea is the holder of the emotions, memories, and souls of each passenger it 
  has overtaken. 

***Continue to be captivated by the sea and have it take you in or try and focus to 
solve a riddle/puzzle to get away and stay on track.  

You finally arrive at the shore of the island that holds Fire Mountain. Thinking to 
see a tropical paradise, you were very disappointed to see there was none. 

Room 10 (Death Valley)

As soon as you step foot on the shore the heat was already too much to bare. You skin
 is burning and the air is hard to breathe. 

**Time Limit to get through death valley. 

Just in the nic of time! Race to Fire Mountain and find the Phoenix. The Phoenix will 
give you clues on how to defeat the Battlegrounds and the weapon you will need.
 
Room 11 (Fire Mountain)

Racing as fast as you can, you make it through the treacherous trail and are at the top. 

**Find the Phoenix.**
Phoenix: “The Savior.”
Name: “No, I am just “Name”. I was told that I could talk to you. I am trying to save 
the princess. She is in terrible danger. The warlock has taken her there.”
Phoenix: “That explains the black clouds I see in the distance. I knew something bad has happened.” 
Name: “The clouds are spreading faster and we are all going to perish. Please help me. 
Please help my mother and all the people in the village.”
Phoenix : “I will take you to the battlegrounds. It is an eerie place so I will not stay
 with you there. My only advice to you is move swiftly and use your weapon wisely. Not 
 everything you see is real. Now hop on and let’s get you there.”

****Fly on the phoenix****

The phoenix flies you to the battlegrounds. The clouds in the distance have almost taken 
over the whole village and you know that time is running out. You land on the outskirts 
of the battle field and say goodbye to the Phoenix.

Phoenix: “ Here is a weapon that will help you, Savior. Our lives are in your hands.”


Room 12 (Battlegrounds)

The Battlegrounds is a place of death and destruction. Everything is gray. The grass. 
The trees. The dirt. Even the sky. Lifeless. Every war that has been fought on this 
ground has been won by the evil kingdom. Desolation comes upon the sky. The ground 
begins to quake. You see fire and smoke burning the breeze as you press forward. Figures 
of the past come from their restless graves to stop you from going any further. You are ready for war.

Name: “If this to end in fire, we shall all burn together.”

You draw your weapon….

****Fight the fallen soldiers.****


Room 13 (The Evil Kingdom)
(I was thinking a simple maze to find the princess and then fight the warlock.)

The last of your journey has finally come. The Evil Kingdom. Hurry and find the princess. 
There is little time to spare. The castle was a labyrinth in its own. Twists and turns all leading nowhere. 

Name: “Princess!! Where are you?!” 

You begin running through the halls of the castle shouting for her. You stop out of 
breath and feeling full of despair. You hear a faint voice.

“The savior! Help Me. Please. The warlock is coming right back. He is going to kill me, please.”
 
You have found the princess! But you hear the footsteps of the warlock heading right toward you.

**** Fight the Warlock.***


You have beaten the warlock and saved the princess! The black clouds disperse from the 
sky as if they had never even been there. You return the princess to her kingdom as 
everyone in the village dance in the streets cheering your name. The King was so impressed 
with you and your skills, he gives you the Evil Kingdom to make your own. 

You and your mother move to the Evil Kingdom and to make it your home and no longer evil. 
Little did you know there was a curse over the kingdom. The adventure begins again…
